# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! In this repository, you'll find my solutions to various LeetCode problems. I've organized the code and explanations to make it easy for you to navigate and learn from them. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to enhance your problem-solving skills, I hope you find this repository helpful.

## Introduction

LeetCode is a fantastic platform for improving your coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. It offers a wide range of problems that cover various topics, including data structures, algorithms, databases, and more. This repository serves as a place where I store my solutions to these problems, along with explanations, in various programming languages.

Feel free to explore the solutions and explanations. You can use them to learn new concepts, compare your own solutions, or even contribute your own solutions to help the community.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
├── problems
│   ├── problem_001
│   │   ├── solution1.py
│   │   ├── solution2.java
│   │   ├── solution3.cpp
│   │   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
│
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

- **`problems/`**: This directory contains subdirectories named after each problem's identifier (e.g., `problem_001` for the first problem). Inside each problem directory, you'll find the following:
  - Solutions in different programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
  - A `README.md` file that includes the problem statement, my approach, and any additional notes.

- **`README.md`**: You're reading it right now! It provides an overview of this repository and its contents.

- **`.gitignore`**: A file specifying which files and directories should be ignored by Git. It helps keep the repository clean by excluding build files, editor-specific files, and other non-essential items.

## Usage

To use this repository effectively:

1. **Navigate to the specific problem you're interested in**: Inside the `problems/` directory, find the problem identifier that corresponds to the LeetCode problem you want to explore.

2. **Choose your preferred programming language**: Each problem directory may contain multiple solutions in different programming languages. Choose the one that suits your needs.

3. **Read the `README.md`**: This file provides a detailed explanation of the problem, the approach I took, and any important insights or considerations.

4. **Review the code**: Open the solution file in your chosen programming language to see the code implementation. You can also modify and run the code to experiment and learn.
